My hobby project for creating remote controlled toy with camera :P I used ESP-32Cam and wemos motor shield. It utilizes OTA updates (for safety of my USB ports in my computer ;) ) and WiFi WebSockets to handle motion commands. For controlling it im using xbox controller in my Android application. My android app also shows logs from device like battery and errors.
